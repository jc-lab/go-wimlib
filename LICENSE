  When not prohibited by a third-party software license, go-wimlib (the library portion of go-wimlib)
  may be redistributed and/or modified under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License; either
  version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

  A copy of this license can be found in the file LICENSE.LGPLv3. This is offered as a "dual license",
  meaning that you can choose either this LGPLv3+ option or the above-mentioned GPLv3+ option.

  The reason for the "when not prohibited by a third-party software license" condition on the LGPL option
  for go-wimlib is that go-wimlib can optionally be linked to the third-party library "libntfs-3g", which
  is licensed under the GPL.

In either case there is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.
